The `make_movie.sh` was retrieved from the [Smokeview repository](https://github.com/firemodels/smv/blob/master/Utilities/Scripts/make_movie.sh).
It's used to generate a video from a sequence of PNG files named `<base_name>_<XYZ>`, where `XYZ` is the frame number and `base_name`
is a common prefix across all files to be included in the video.
