# Summary of SeisSol Compilation

- **One-Time Compilation**: Use parameter files to adjust simulation settings without recompiling.
- **Multiple Compilations**: Required for changing the physical model, accuracy order, hardware optimizations, or enabling/disabling specific features.

This flexibility allows SeisSol to be used for a wide range of scenarios, from basic elastic simulations to complex earthquake dynamics involving poroelastic and anisotropic materials.
